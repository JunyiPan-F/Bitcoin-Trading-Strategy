# Interpretability-of- Stock-Trading-Strategy

- This website aims to provide users with a tool to upload CSV files containing stock data and analyze the machine learning-based decision-making process for buying and selling stocks. The primary objective is to interpret the trading strategy employed by the machine learning model and identify the key factors that contribute to its decision-making process.


# Motivation

- The motivation behind building this website is to address the need for transparency and interpretability in automated stock trading systems. Many individuals rely on machine learning algorithms to make trading decisions on their behalf. However, these systems often lack transparency, making it challenging for users to understand the rationale behind the decisions made by the model.

- By creating this website, we aim to bridge the gap between users and machine learning-based trading strategies. We want to empower users by providing them with insights into the decision-making process, allowing them to understand how various factors influence the model's trading strategy. This interpretability will enable users to make more informed investment decisions and gain a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanics of stock trading algorithms.

# Features
The website will offer the following features:
- Upload CSV File: Users can upload CSV files containing historical stock data.
- Machine Learning Analysis: The uploaded data will be analyzed using machine learning algorithms to generate trading decisions.
- Strategy Interpretation: The website will interpret the trading strategy employed by the machine learning model.
- Factor Analysis: Users will be able to explore the factors that contribute the most to the decision-making process.
- Visualization: The website will provide visual representations of the trading strategy and the influential factors to enhance user understanding.
